# Overview

In this project, you will implement a vulnerable C program which has a buffer overflow vulnerability. You will then demonstrate how you can win a game which is supposed to be unwinnable. You achieve this goal via exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability.

# Specification

We will determine you win the game if the program prints "You won!". 

- Your must use your seat number as your buffer size - this guarantees' everyone's solution would be different.
- You are not allowed to change the main function(). However, you can change your_fcn() in whatever ways as you like.
- Hardcoding is okay.

# Grading Rubric

All grading will be executed on onyx.boisestate.edu. Submissions that fail to compile will not being graded.

- [10 pts] Compiler warnings ALL files.
Each compiler warning will result in a 3 point deduction.
You are not allowed to suppress warnings.
- [40 pts] You win everytime the program runs.
