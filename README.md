# Overview

In this project, you will implement a vulnerable C program which has a buffer overflow vulnerability. You will then demonstrate how you can win a game which is supposed to be unwinnable. You achieve this goal via exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability.

# Specification

We will determine you win the game if the program prints "You won!". 

- You are not allowed to change the main function(). 
- You can change your_fcn() in whatever ways as you like, but you must exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability, as opposed to an integer overflow vulnerability.
- Your must use your seat number as your buffer size - this guarantees everyone's solution would be different.
- Hardcoding is okay.

<!--# Due Date

23:59pm, 01/18/2022. Late submissions will not be accepted/graded.

# Grading Rubric

This is just a warm-up project, and therefore you do not earn any credit for completing this; and your submission will not be graded. However, if you are not able to complete this project, then you are not likely to complete any of the 10 programming assignments.

Our general rules are: for user-level programming assignments, all grading will be executed on onyx.boisestate.edu. Submissions that fail to compile will not be graded.
